<h2 align='center'>About Me:</h2>

Hello! My name is Bryce Cazier, welcome to my GitHub. I'm a Fullstack Developer, experienced in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, React, and TypeScript. In my Projects section, you'll find links to various apps I've developed. 

I'm highly creative, while simultaneously being analytical. I also speak Spanish and have a love of languages. I found a career that allows me to combine all of these! In my former job as a manufacturing technician I worked in a creative environment where I needed to be focused on producing a consistent product that not only was fully functional, but aesthetically pleasing. I was involved in the development process and editing of materials and products to make production more efficient. I often had to work under pressure to meet deadlines, while keeping product at a uniform standard. This started me on the track to forge a career for myself that utilized these skills. Several of my close friends in the industry felt strongly that I would thrive as a software engineer, and after researching and trying some things out for myself, I made the dive in and I couldn't be happier.

My dog, Kaia is the most important thing in the world to me. She goes everywhere with me! She's a Siberian Husky puppy and a real handful, but I love her despite all the trouble she gets into, which has granted her the nickname "Miss Mayhem".

I also paint with watercolor in my pastime, a hobby I started several years ago. My creativity has had a major impact on the way I approach problems. In watercolor, you need to think carefully about the big picture. Unlike oil paints and acrylics, you can't just paint over a mistake. Things show through! And overworking the paint will quickly muddy the paint and give a sub-par result. I need to be precise and efficient with the way I paint, giving each brush stroke meaning. In the same way, I like to think about the big picture with my code. What am I trying to achieve? What's the end result? How can I get from Point A to Point B in the fewest number of steps, and the fastest way, to make sure things run smoothly and efficiently and I keep my code dry.
